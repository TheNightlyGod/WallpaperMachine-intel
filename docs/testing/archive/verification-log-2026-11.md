# Verification log archive — 2026-11 and earlier

Retired entries from [../verification-log.md](../verification-log.md), moved
here when that log was capped at its ten newest entries. No recorded result was
rewritten: each entry is reproduced verbatim, and the only edit is that
relative Markdown links gained one `../` for this file's extra directory
level.

These are historical results about the trees they were taken on. They are not
evidence about the current tree and must never be cited as such.

## 2026-11-03 — Web lock screen: a busy page no longer fails its pause or resume

- Symptom: a 3D web wallpaper sometimes held a still frame on lock; the app log showed 'The web wallpaper did not produce a frame in time.' at unlock and the lock screen was handed back to macOS.
- Unified log: on resume the extension's WebKit GPU process got a process-limit-critical memory event (32) and WebKit's display link reported the main thread stuck; the page's property delivery ran only after the 5 s transition deadline had closed the page.
- Fix: ScreenSaverWebSurface bounds waits on the page (properties, media, held frame) at 5 s and goes on without them; only WebKit's suspend/resume not answering within 15 s fails the surface.
- New test ScreenSaverWebSurfaceTests/testABusyPageIsStillResumedAndPausedWithoutFailingTheSurface fails on the old reconcile with timedOut, passes with the fix.
- python3 scripts/test.py: 4291 passed, 0 failed, 53 skipped. Release build OK.
- Not verified: repeated real locks with the user's wallpaper; why the GPU process reaches its limit on resume (two copies of a heavy page: desktop and lock screen) is not addressed.

## 2026-11-03 — Web lock screen and screen saver: export the live page, not only its snapshot

- Symptom after the issue 155 change: a web wallpaper on the lock screen showed a still frame; extension.log showed it was not paused while locked.
- Cause: ScreenSaverWebSurface.attach added the content view's backing layer to the exported root; AppKit kept it in the window's tree, so the CAContext held only the readiness snapshot beneath it (screen saver too).
- Headless probe (never-ordered window, CARenderer over the root): old attach left the root empty; exporting the frame view layer rendered the page's canvas alternating red/blue.
- New test ScreenSaverWebSurfaceTests/testTheLivePageStaysInTheLayerTreeItWasAttachedTo fails on the old attach, passes with the fix.
- python3 scripts/test.py: 4290 passed, 0 failed, 53 skipped. Release build: python3 scripts/build.py --swift-only --configuration Release, OK.
- Not verified: a real lock with the web wallpaper (the user's next run), and the screen saver on a real idle.

## 2026-11-03 — Web and still wallpapers animate the lock screen (issue 155)

- Change: web projects (and still images, which are web projects) are published for Animate lock screen, take the Desktop selection and follow the lock-screen settle/pause policy in the extension; the 'not applicable' status and compatibility verdict are gone.
- python3 scripts/test.py --only LockScreenWallpaperServiceTests --only WallpaperCompatibilityTests --only ScreenSaverWebSurfaceTests --only WallpaperPresentationAuthorityTests: 108 passed.
- python3 scripts/test.py: 4289 passed, 0 failed, 53 skipped; Python stage (localization catalogs, panel localization, doc links) OK.
- New test: a web wallpaper takes the lock screen and keeps it when the screen saver turns off.
- Catalogs: five web-surface errors reworded from 'web screen saver' to 'web wallpaper' in both catalogs; compatibility and Settings copy updated; three unused keys removed; all six languages.
- Not verified: a real lock/unlock with a web wallpaper on the desktop, extension WebKit memory while held, no Release build.

## 2026-11-02 — When another app is in front (discussion #91)

- Feature: Settings → Playback & Power gains When another app is in front (Keep running / Mute / Pause), default Keep running.
- AppRuleMonitor adds the chosen action while the frontmost app is not Finder or this app; no app in front counts as the desktop.
- python3 scripts/test.py --only AppRuleMonitorTests, PlaybackPreferencesTests, PanelSettingsResetTests, ConditionOverrideTests and six more Panel/Backup classes: 120 passed.
- python3 scripts/test.py: Python stage OK; native 4287 passed, 0 failed, 53 skipped.
- Localization catalog and panel localization checks pass; five languages added for title, note and prose.
- Not checked: the setting on a real desktop (no desktop run requested); the app was not rebuilt.

## 2026-11-01 — Discord invitation, About entry and Help menu item

A fifth one-time prompt, Join us on Discord?, invites once to MMFoundation's Discord through https://mmfoundation.dev/discord (ExternalLink.discord, allowlisted; never the invite itself), last in priority, after 21 days and 7 days of panel use on the star prompt's clock. Settings › About gains Join Discord beside MMFoundation and the Help menu gains Join Discord; either spends the invitation. Strings in all six languages.

- `python3 scripts/test.py --only SupportPromptStoreTests --only PanelSupportPromptTests --only SupportPromptPresenterTests --only WelcomeRenderTests --only SettingsSectionsLocalizationTests --only ExternalLinkTests` — 62 passed (after `xattr -cr build/Build/Products/Debug`, docs/build.md)
- `python3 scripts/test.py` — 4268 passed, 0 failed, 52 skipped
- `python3 scripts/build.py --swift-only --configuration Release` — OK
- Sheet (en, zh-Hans) and Settings › About (en, zh-Hans) rendered offscreen from a never-shown window to check the layout; the app was not launched and the Help menu item was not opened by hand

## 2026-11-01 — MMFoundation link in Settings › About

Settings › About gains an MMFoundation button beside the GPL link, opening https://mmfoundation.dev/ through ExternalLink's allowlist (mmfoundation.dev added); READMEs in all four languages name MMFoundation with a link. Run while another task's uncommitted Spaces/desktop-picture edits were in the same checkout.

- `python3 scripts/test.py --only ExternalLinkTests` — 5 passed (after `xattr -cr build/Build/Products/Debug`, docs/build.md)
- `python3 scripts/test.py --only SettingsSectionsLocalizationTests` — 2 passed; MMFoundation added to its same-everywhere names
- `python3 scripts/test.py` — first run 2 failed: the localization test above (fixed) and EnergyUsageMonitorTests.testKernelCountersForThisProcessAdvanceWithGPUWork (3.4 mW, hardware counter); rerun 4258 passed, 0 failed, 52 skipped
- Not checked: the button on screen (no desktop run requested); no Release build
