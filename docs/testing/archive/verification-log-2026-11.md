# Verification log archive — 2026-11 and earlier

Retired entries from [../verification-log.md](../verification-log.md), moved
here when that log was capped at its ten newest entries. No recorded result was
rewritten: each entry is reproduced verbatim, and the only edit is that
relative Markdown links gained one `../` for this file's extra directory
level.

These are historical results about the trees they were taken on. They are not
evidence about the current tree and must never be cited as such.

## 2026-11-01 — Discord invitation, About entry and Help menu item

A fifth one-time prompt, Join us on Discord?, invites once to MMFoundation's Discord through https://mmfoundation.dev/discord (ExternalLink.discord, allowlisted; never the invite itself), last in priority, after 21 days and 7 days of panel use on the star prompt's clock. Settings › About gains Join Discord beside MMFoundation and the Help menu gains Join Discord; either spends the invitation. Strings in all six languages.

- `python3 scripts/test.py --only SupportPromptStoreTests --only PanelSupportPromptTests --only SupportPromptPresenterTests --only WelcomeRenderTests --only SettingsSectionsLocalizationTests --only ExternalLinkTests` — 62 passed (after `xattr -cr build/Build/Products/Debug`, docs/build.md)
- `python3 scripts/test.py` — 4268 passed, 0 failed, 52 skipped
- `python3 scripts/build.py --swift-only --configuration Release` — OK
- Sheet (en, zh-Hans) and Settings › About (en, zh-Hans) rendered offscreen from a never-shown window to check the layout; the app was not launched and the Help menu item was not opened by hand

## 2026-11-01 — MMFoundation link in Settings › About

Settings › About gains an MMFoundation button beside the GPL link, opening https://mmfoundation.dev/ through ExternalLink's allowlist (mmfoundation.dev added); READMEs in all four languages name MMFoundation with a link. Run while another task's uncommitted Spaces/desktop-picture edits were in the same checkout.

- `python3 scripts/test.py --only ExternalLinkTests` — 5 passed (after `xattr -cr build/Build/Products/Debug`, docs/build.md)
- `python3 scripts/test.py --only SettingsSectionsLocalizationTests` — 2 passed; MMFoundation added to its same-everywhere names
- `python3 scripts/test.py` — first run 2 failed: the localization test above (fixed) and EnergyUsageMonitorTests.testKernelCountersForThisProcessAdvanceWithGPUWork (3.4 mW, hardware counter); rerun 4258 passed, 0 failed, 52 skipped
- Not checked: the button on screen (no desktop run requested); no Release build
